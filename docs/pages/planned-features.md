# Planned Features

These are some of the features that I'm planning to add to Notebutler in the
future.

- A sharing system for notes.
- Working frontmatter in templates. Would be useful for building websites (e.g. naming documents, etc)

If you have any suggestions or feature requests, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/marcusleonas/notebutler/issues/new).
