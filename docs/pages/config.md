# Config

Notebutler uses a simple JSON config file to store some of its settings. At the
moment, it isn't used for anything other than to hold the notebook's name. In the
future I would like to add a build system to generate a website based on your notes.

## Example

```json
{
  "name": "My Notebook"
}
```
